<h1>Just a attempt to make me more lazy and expressive about the mood through Govee Lights. PS if anyone find this then enjoy the power of ai to expres your mood to YOUR GOVEE Device (When govee releases more api to play around I will update the code with details)

<p> Currently the interface supports 2 functionalities 
1. Get state of devices to verify if the device is conncted to your network in order to make api request and change the value of colors. PS CURRENTLY GOVEE API CAN LET US MODIFY THE STATE OF DEVICE (ON/OFF)
  i.e  BRIGHTNESS, TEMP, RGB VALUES\
2. TRANSMIT YOUR VOICE TO AI TO GENERATE RGB values to simulate the mood and also it handles brightness</p>
